# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust model for automated sentiment classification of Amazon reviews into positive or negative categories.

## Abstract
In this project:

- **Data Exploration:** We ensured a balanced dataset with equal numbers of positive and negative reviews and gained insights into review lengths.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** We preprocessed a sample of 10,000 reviews by removing special characters, digits, punctuation, and stop words, and converting text to lowercase.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** Numerical features were generated using CountVectorizer to enhance the modeling process.
  
- **Modeling:** Various algorithms including Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and BERT (Transformer-based model) were implemented and evaluated.
  
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as ROC-AUC score and accuracy were used to compare and identify the best-performing model for sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews.

This project's outcomes provide valuable insights and recommendations for selecting an optimal model for similar sentiment analysis tasks.
